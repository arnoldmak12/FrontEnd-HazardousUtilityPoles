# Hazardous Utility Poles
A website that lets you upload images + metadata of utility poles and approximate how much each one is leaning in real time.
* Live site: https://utilitypolesafetyevaluator.herokuapp.com/

## Additional Resources
* Repo for the back-end API: https://github.com/Rocksrock18/Lean-Calculator

## Uploading Data
Upload the image of the pole and the corresponding metadata into the dropbox.
* **Note:** Metadata will need to have a specific format. Visit our [back-end repository](https://github.com/Rocksrock18/Lean-Calculator) to see how this is formatted.
If you don't have any, you can download some data that we have provided.

## Interpreting the Results
It'll take a few seconds to start loading in your results. As they come in, you should see markers start to come up on the map.

Markers will have one of 4 colors representing the status of each pole:
* Red: Lean factor > 10
* Orange: Lean factor > 5
* Yellow: Lean factor > 2.5
* Green: Lean factor < 2.5
